The chat panel lets you describe changes in natural language. Select elements to provide context, take screenshots, and let the AI update your code.

<Info>
  Inspector requires an AI agent to apply code changes. See [Connecting AI Agents](/connecting-ai-agents) to set one up.

## Selecting elements

Click any element to select it. Selected elements are automatically added as context when you send chat messages, helping the AI understand exactly what you want to change.

  Inspector will automatically find the exact lines of code of the component you selected for React projects.
